- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kuntal
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D candidate in Physics working on research projects that involve using low-rank tensor completion for neural architecture search and looking for new physics signals utilizing unsupervised techniques used for anomaly detection.

- ðŸ‘€ I am seeking full-time positions in data science and machine learning where I can use my skills and expertise to contribute to innovative projects. My programming skills include proficiency in Python and SQL. I am well-versed in Python-based deep learning frameworks - PyTorch and TensorFlow, along with several python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. 

- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach me at kpal002@ucr.edu
