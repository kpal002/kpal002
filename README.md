- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kuntal
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D candidate in Physics working on research projects that involve using low-rank tensor completion for neural architecture search and looking for new physics signals utilizing unsupervised techniques used for anomaly detection.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m an aspiring data scientist with a deep interest in machine learning and AI research.
- I am seeking full-time data science and machine learning opportunities where I can use my skills and expertise to contribute to innovative projects. My programming skills include proficiency in Python and beginner-level experience with C/C++. I am proficient in various ML/data analysis libraries, including Keras, Tensorflow, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. I also have experience with database languages such as SQL.
